# HorseFinder

HorseFinder is an app I wrote in class which emulates the FriendFinder concept but aligns a bit closer to my business. 

## Installation

Installation for this app is simple. Just go to 

[Horse Finder Web Site](https://hidden-badlands-52324.herokuapp.com)


## Deployment

I used [Heroku] (www.heroku.com) for the deployment platform and it was pretty straightforward to deploy. 

I used the following techologies to create the app
* [express](https://expressjs.com)
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [js](https://www.javascript.com)
* [json](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
